### Introdction

Cyclistic, in 2016, launched a successful bike-share offering. Since that time, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The company has 3 flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. The finance team have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. I assume the position of a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team. The marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ in their use of the Cyclistic bikes, so as to design new marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

#### Business Task

The business task is to use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and understand trends of the two customer types.
